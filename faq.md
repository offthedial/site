## It’s Dangerous to go Alone
### What is It’s Dangerous to go Alone?
It’s Dangerous to go Alone is a tournament that sorts free agents into teams, and then those teams play each other until one is crowned victory! Teams are balanced based on a players ranks, play style and tournament experience.

### What does IDTGA stand for?
IDTGA is our way of shortening It’s Dangerous to go Alone.

### Is there a skill limit/cap?
No, we understand that if you don't have a team and want to experience a tournament you are not likely to be an X rank. Therefore we have no skill limit. Any player from C- to X can play in IDTGA.

### Can I still play if I'm already on a team?
Even if you're already on a team you and your teammates can still play, just don't expect to be on the same team.

### How the balancing system works
We use an ELO system (named after Arpad Elo) which assigns players numerical values for all aspects of teams. This includes ranks, play style and tournament experience (but they’re separated into different variables.)

### When do we receive our teams?
Teams are released 24 hours before the tournament commences.

### Why is check-in so early?
This is so we can confirm you are playing before we sort players into teams. It is a way we minimise dropouts.

### Why is there also check-in for each match on smash.gg?
This is a setting that comes default with smash.gg and there is no way to disable it, so make sure you check in for every match you play!

### I’ve just finished a season of IDTGA, what do I do now?
If you’re playing in Swiss or Round Robin, make sure that all your rounds are completed. If you didn’t make the finals feel free to watch the rest of the stream on https://twitch.tv/offthedial. Shortly after the tournament finishes, a feedback forum will be released. We would appreciate it if you gave honest feedback that can improve the next season.

### Why is it now bi-monthly instead of monthly?
Really simple actually. It’s because I’m (DJam98) in my final year of high school this year. On the off months, LeptoFlare will be running the Weakest Link tournament (of which I will still assist in but not to the same extent as IDTGA).

### Why make IDTGA a league?
So we can have a leaderboard for players who often play in the tournament and to group the tournaments onto one single page

## Off the Dial Story Mode
### What is the Off the Dial Story Mode
There is an ongoing story with Off the Dial behind the scenes and it is your job to find out what is happening. Leading up to the tournament, there are be lore drops. The result of the tournament will decide what happens next. For more information ask other people on the server and make your predictions and dicsuss lore in `#crime-scene` If you want to be serious about lore, you can give yourself the `@Detective` role with `$flairme flairs` to ensure you get notified of each new lore drop. Plus, you get a fancy role.

### What’s different about this to regular IDTGA?
In terms of the actual competition, very little. It is still a free agent tournament at it’s core. The only difference is that after the regular finals match there will be an additional finals round against a pre-determined team called the final boss. This is kept secret until the round begins or may be disclosed in clues prior to the tournament’s commencement

## Weakest Link
### What is Weakest Link?
Weakest link is a unique, Off the Dial exclusive, tournament featuring both teams and free agents! Sign up as a 3 player team and get paired up with a lone FA.

### Is there a skill limit/cap, and can I still play as a FA if I'm already on a team?
There is a skill limit for teams, and there is a skill cap for players, if you are a FA above the skill cap, you can create a pickup team, if you are a team below the skill limit, you can sign up as a FA instead.

## Off the Dial Bot
### What is Off the Dial Bot?
Off the Dial Bot is a custom built bot by `@LeptoFlare`, It provides many commands that help us run tournaments more smoothly.

### What is my 'Signal Strength'?
Your Signal Strength is our internal way of calculating your tournament experience while being here on Off the Dial. As it was only introduced at the start of 2020, we'll still be asking for your previous OTD experience in registration forms until the Signal Strength is an accurate representation. You gain strength by playing in tournaments as well as by placing high in the tournaments.

### Is Off the Dial Bot open-sourced?
Yes! You can find all the code on Github at https://github.com/LeptoFlare/offthedialbot.

### I have a suggestion/bug report for Off the Dial Bot.
I'd love it if you made a Github Issue using this link: https://github.com/LeptoFlare/offthedialbot/issues/new/choose. This lets us track all of the suggestions and reports permanently in one place, as opposed to the suggestions channel, where the messages can get easily lost.

## Definitions
**DC**: Disconnect
**KO**: Knockout
**Groups/Pools**: In order to finish large events in a timely manner, most organisers will split up the attendees into
**Groups** (more commonly referred to as Pools in the FGC). By having a smaller player group, you can eliminate players faster than if it were all just a single bracket. Pools will always progress into another elimination phase.
**FA**: Free agent (any player who isn’t on a team)
**Round**: A group of sets in a bracket *Ex: “I lost in the first round of winners, so now I’m in the first round of losers”.*
**Match/Set**: The act of two players sitting down to determine a winner during an event. Sets are decided by winning a predetermined number of games.
**Game**: Players interacting within the video game until the game (or tournament rules) decides a victor. The end of a game is usually denoted by KO! or GAME!, or a bunch of people loudly reacting.
**Best of**:  Number of games required to determine a winner of a set, once a comeback is impossible, the set it over *Ex: “We will play a BO3 and the first team to win twice is determined the champions.*
**Play All**: Number of games to be played in a set, but unlike a Best Of, this requires all games in a set to be played *Ex. A PA3 means 3 games will have to be played, regardless if a team has already won two games*
**Open Bracket**: *A bracket/event that anyone can register and enter to compete in.*

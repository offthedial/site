# IDTGA Rules

## Info
<u>It’s Dangerous to go Alone</u> is a free agent tournament for Splatoon 2! In a free agent tournament, you don’t sign up with a team. We place you into teams balanced by playstyles, tournament experience and ranks. This tournament is open to anyone, no matter the skill level. Better yet, each team has a chance of winning.

All you need to do is sign up! The world is waiting…

## Registration
To register, simply enter `$signup` in `#bot-commands`! The bot will guide you through the complete process. If you have any questions or issues with the bot, feel free to ask in `#helpdesk` or `#user-support` on the [LeptoServer](https://discord.gg/faUNrfP).

## Format
Complete teams will consist of four players.

### Preliminaries:
- Swiss Pools
- Each pool has a maximum of 16 teams.
- Teams are evenly distributed across pools.
- 4 Rounds
- PA3

### Top Cut:
- Single Elimination - No 3rd place match.
- At least 1 team per pool, with a minimum of 4 teams total.
- BO5

## Timing & Round Duration
- The first round of the day goes for 45 minutes.
- All other preliminary matches will go for 40 minutes.
- There is no time limit on the finals.
- After the round has completed, any unreported games will automatically be reported as empty.
- There will be a five-minute break before the first finals match.
- If you finish a round early, you must wait for the next round to begin.

## Subs
### Rotational Subs
Due to an uneven amount of players, TO’s may assign a team an extra player.

- Certain players in the team will be predetermined as the rotational subs
- Only players designated as the subs can rotate with each other
- After each **round**, the player who subbed out must rotate with another of the rotational subs.

### Emergency Subs
In the case of a dropout, an emergency sub may be needed.

- Emergency subs must be of similar rank and play style to the missing player
- Must be approved by a TO.
- Players can apply to be an emergency sub before the tournament by sending a dm to `@DJam98`.

## DC's Redo Decision Rules
### Redo the match if:
- The team with the DC stops playing and allows the other team to KO.
- The team with the DC stays inside their spawn barrier.
- The team with the DC uses the same weapons/gear shown in the results.

### Do NOT redo the match if:
- **Any player** on the same team DC's again in the same round.
- The same player DC's again **any other time** in the tournament.
- The host DC's.
- The match has passed 2:30 before the DC'ing team has forfeited.
- The team without a DC has 50 or less objective remaining (excluding penalty).

If either 2 DC’s occur in the same lobby or the host DC’s, the team currently not hosting must host a new lobby.

To reduce the chances of a dc happening, please check you have a good internet connection with low ping and/or have a LAN adapter for a smoother experience. If not, consider switching hosts.

## Dropouts
For everyone's sake, ***please*** do not drop out.

### The Dropout
#### If you refuse to play after teams have been created:
- You will not be able to play in the next month **and** season of IDTGA.
- You will not be given the winner’s role if your team wins.
- You will not receive any Signal Strength for the tournament.

#### This can be avoided if:
- You have an approved sub ready to go **before** you drop out, or you let us know **before** teams are created.

### For the teams who suffer:
#### If one on your team has dropped out:
- Your team (Including the dropout) are responsible for finding a substitute.
- The substitute must be approved by one of the TO’s.
- You may be granted a little bit of time to search if in the first round, but you may have to do a 3v3 scenario, (see below).

#### Matches with a dropout:
- A 3v3 game will occur.
- By pinging `@DJam98`, he will tell you the player that should sit out to be an even match-up.

## Cheating
Forms of cheating include, but are not limited to, playing under false names, bracket manipulation, providing false information in your profile or on smash.gg, anything considered cheating by Nintendo, and failure to comply with any of the rules on this document.

If you cheat:

- Instant disqualification from the tournament.
- A permanent ban from Off the Dial and all tournaments.

This is a strict no-chances policy, and we do not make exceptions to this.

## Other Rules
- If there's are complaints about lag from at least 3 people on the same team or 1 person from each team, teams are required to switch hosts to someone on the opposing team.
- Teams will be released 24 hours before the tournament begins.
